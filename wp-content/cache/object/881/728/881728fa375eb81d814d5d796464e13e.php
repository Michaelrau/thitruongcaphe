HANOI, May 11 (Reuters) - Coffee export markets were quiet this week as IndonesiaÂ is on holiday while premiums in VietnamÂ edged lower on weak demand, traders said on Thursday.

The 5 percent black and broken grade 2 robusta in Vietnam, the world's largest grower of robusta beans, was quoted at a premium of $10-$20 per tonne toÂ London's ICE July contract, easing from last week's $20-$30 premiums.

"The market is very slow. Foreigners are not buying ... they might have bought enough beans already," said Le Duc Huy, Deputy general director of Simexco, a leading exporter in Daklak, the country's largest coffee growing province.

Coffee traded locally at 44,000 dong ($1.94) to 44,500 dong ($1.96) per kg, down slightly from 44,800-45,000 dong a week earlier, traders said, adding that farmers are still eyeing a price hike before releasing more beans.

"Local prices used to be 46,000-47,000 dong just recently, so farmers feel that selling at this price is just ugly, they are not ready to live with low prices yet," said <strong>Nguyen Quang Binh</strong>, head of the coffee section at Visimex Joint-Stock Company.

"They are waiting for some price changes," he added.

Vietnam's coffee exports in April were revised down to 135,000 tonnes (2.25 million 60-kg bags) from an earlier forecast of 150,000 tonnes. April exports of the beans declined 19.8 percent from the same month last year.

Indonesian markets are closed on Thursday for a public holiday.
