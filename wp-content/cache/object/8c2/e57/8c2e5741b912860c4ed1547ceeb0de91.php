Exporters quoted the 5 percent black and broken grade 2 robusta in Vietnam, the world's top robusta maker, at $30-$40 premium a tonne to London's ICE July contract , compared with $20-$40 premiums last week.

London prices have dropped a combined 4.6 percent during the past week to end at $1905 on Wednesday.

"There were bids and asks, but no actual trade as London prices dropped while local prices are yet to keep pace with the decline," said <strong>independent analyst Nguyen Quang Binh</strong>.

Local prices quoted by Vietnamese farmers on Thursday edged down to around 42,000 dong ($1.85) per kg, from 44,000 dong-44,500 dong a week ago, which traders said, make export quotes higher than import offers.

"At 42,000 dong input cost, traders will still suffer from a loss if selling to foreign importers. Therefore, they were reluctant to conclude transaction," <strong>Binh added</strong>.

Vietnam is forecast to harvest 28.6 million bags (1.72 million tons) of coffee from its next 2017/2018 crop, a rise of 10 percent from the current season, due to favourable weather conditions and higher domestic prices, a U.S. Department of Agriculture attache said.

In Indonesia, Vietnam's major coffee competitor, traders said prices have improved this week. The robusta grade 4 defect 80 was quoted at $20-$30 discount to July contract, slightly up from $20 discount last week.

"Prices are a little bit better and stable because of a drop in London terminal prices to around $1,900 (per tonne)," a trader in Bandar Lampung said, adding that inventories at trading houses remained steady as supplies continued to stream in.

Indonesia's market was closed on Thursday for a public holiday. ($1=22,688 dong)
